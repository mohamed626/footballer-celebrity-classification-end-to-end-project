# footballer-celebrity-classification-end-to-end-project
 we are beginning end to end machine learning project or data science project for footballer celebrity image classification.
- after we download the dataset ,prepareing and cleaning it, and bulid classification learning model using SVM, You can see this through this link (https://github.com/mohamed626/Data-Cleaning-and-model-for-footballer-celebrity-classification)

- now we will write a flask server that will use the trained model and perform image classification.and bulid UI, UI will talk to this backend server and perform image classification task for our footballer person identification project.
- someone can drag and drop an image of a person and it will identify that person. The image classification is restricted to only 5 classes or 5 footballer people. We will use HTML/CSS/Javascript for this project. JQuery is used to make http calls to python flask backend. 

# In short, we're going to do this.
1.Export model to a file and write python flask server around it that can server http requests generated by UI.
2.Build ui using HTML,CSS,javascript and JQuery.
